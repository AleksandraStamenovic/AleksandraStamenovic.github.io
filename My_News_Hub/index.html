		<h2>Grand Opening of “Zum Griechen”</h2>
		<p>
			Mark your calendars for <i>Sunday, 26. May 2024,</i> as a new dining and partying experience is set to arrive to the neighbourhood. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>“Zum Griechen”</u>, the new culinary experience of the neighbourhood proudly introduced by the new CEO, Franz Kafka. The grand opening takes place at Naturfreundestrasse 35, Waakirchen, starting at 18 o’clock. 
		</p>
		<p> 
			Guests can look forward to a delicious Greek cuisine, as well as a band that will feature traditional Greek music, which will transport us all to sandy Greek beaches. <br>
			And for our nightbird Guests, there will be a DJ that will preform into the late hours (specifically 3 hours after midnight). <br>
			However, that is not everything that this new opening has to offer. For all ladies visiting “Zum Griechen”, there is a special treat: Complementary drinks courtesy of the house.
