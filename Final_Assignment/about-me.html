				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>
					Karate is not just a martial art; it’s a journey of discipline, strength, and perseverance. For those who have dedicated years to mastering its techniques, as I dedicated 9 of mine, the black belt is a symbol of their hard work and commitment. Among these dedicated practitioners, women have made significant strides, breaking barriers and setting new standards. Here I would like to celebrate some of women who inspired me and many other girls to join and to work hard to achieve my karate goals.
